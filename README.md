# Arabic Sign Language Interpreter

A real-time Arabic Sign Language Interpreter that recognizes Arabic letters using webcam hand gestures. Built with *MediaPipe, **Streamlit, and a **custom-trained machine learning model*.

## ðŸš€ Demo

You can try the app online using [Streamlit Cloud](https://tasneemdweiri-arabic-sign-language-interpreter.streamlit.app).

## ðŸ“š Description

This project uses a *webcam* to recognize *Arabic Sign Language* gestures, converting them into Arabic letters in real-time. The system processes hand landmarks using *MediaPipe* and applies a *machine learning model* trained on a custom dataset of Arabic sign language gestures. The model is served through a *Streamlit web app*, providing an intuitive interface for easy usage.

### Key Features:
- Real-time Sign Language Recognition : Detect Arabic letters from webcam input.
- AI-Powered: Custom-trained machine learning model for gesture recognition.
- Interactive Interface: Built with Streamlit for easy-to-use, browser-based interaction.
- Supports Arabic Letters: Specifically designed for Arabic Sign Language (different from ASL).

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Machine Learning : Scikit-learn (for training the model)
- Webcam Hand Gesture Detection: MediaPipe
- Web App Interface: Streamlit
- Data Processing: OpenCV, NumPy
- Arabic Text Rendering: arabic-reshaper, python-bidi
